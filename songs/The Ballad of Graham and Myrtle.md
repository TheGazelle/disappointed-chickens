#The Ballad of Graham and Myrtle
*By The Disappointed Chickens*  

In a small English town  
Was a young man called Potter  
Searching for a girl  
While the day got hotter.   

He thought to himself  
What could her name be?  
Enid, Matilda,  
Or just Rosemarie,  

Maybe she's fast,   
Or slow like a turtle,  
Or maybe, just maybe  
Her first name is Myrtle  

At that very moment  
A girl strolled by  
Looking at something  
She saw in the sky  

He met that young girl,  
She became Mrs Potter  
And together they raised  
A very fine daughter.  

The daughter grew up  
Told this story to friends  
One of them was me  
And here the song ends
