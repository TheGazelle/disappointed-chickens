#The Tickle Ninjas
*By T.D. Chicken*

Late at night, I'm deep asleep,  
Dad's not up, there's not a peep.  
A puff of smoke, one, two, three!  
Tickle Ninjas are coming for me!  

It's true! There's Blue,  
And Red and Pink,  
Running faster than I can blink!  

I heard a noise, I'm wide awake,  
Tickle Ninjas, please don't take  
my blankets off! Why won't they see?  
Tickle Ninjas! Don't tickle me!  

Blue's on my leg ,  
And Red's on my head,  
And Pink is crawling from the top of the bed!  

They've got me now, I can't resist!  
Tickle Ninjas, won't you desist?  
I call to Dad,  
I wish he had   
a great big broom,  
To sweep the ninjas from the room!  

Dad comes in, turns the light on bright,  
The ninjas chuckle with delight,  
"Dad's here!" they yell, and dance and shout,  
But dad picks them up and throws them out!  

One, two, three, a puff of smoke,  
No sound except a froggy's croak,  
They're gone tonight, I know I'm right,  
I can sleep until the morning light!
