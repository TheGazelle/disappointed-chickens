# Thanks for the Raccoon Anus

In the world today,
Many things pain us,
And one of those things,
Is raccoon anus

There's plenty to see,
Things to entertain us,
So I say it again,
No more raccoon anus

Raccoons can be cute,
From the front and the side,
But racoons from the back,
Are something to hide. 

Some anus I will,
And some anus I won't,
But raccoon anus?
I definitely don't

Not in the car,
Not in a bar,
Not in a hat,
Nothing like that,
Not in the morning, 
Not without warning,
Not in a song,
And not all day long
