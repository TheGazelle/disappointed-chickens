# Rachel's Lament (the laundry song)  
*Performed by: The Disappointed Chickens*  

CHORUS:  
I could've been a queen,  
I could've been a wanderer.  
But I'm just a lonely cowgirl,  
better listener than a launderer  

I've traveled this country from here to BC,  
I've seen all the things that they say you should see,  
Like the big goose at Wawa, and Mr PG,  
But one thing's for certain, there's too much laundry.  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
Tell me your troubles and I'll give you advice,  
But bring me your laundry and I won't be so nice,  
Come over to my house and we'll watch tv,  
But don't ever try to bring your laundry.  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
(Twangy banjo solo)  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
Oh, it's washing and washing and washing all day,  
And every time I just have to say,  
Eff all this laundry, I wish it was done,  
I'm going outside to just have some fun.  
  
(CHORUS)
