#Treejuice (A camping song)
*By The Disappointed Chickens*  
  
*CHORUS*  
C'mon baby, juice my tree,  
C'mon baby come play with me,  
Juice it good,  
It's made of wood,  
Let's go baby, come and see  
  
We'll hike out to the forest,  
You know, you know you should,  
Help me get the tent pitched,  
And then you'll find some wood  
  
(CHORUS)
  
Let's go out on the lake,  
It's gonna be so wet,  
Up and down with the waves,  
You'll have treejuice soon, I bet  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
Watch out for the beaver  
I can tell it's on the loose,  
It's looking for some wood to chew,  
To get at that treejuice  
  
(CHORUS)
