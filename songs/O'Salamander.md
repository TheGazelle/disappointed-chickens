#O'Salamander
*By The Disappointed Chickens*  
  
O'Salamander,  
O'Salamander,  
She left you and her  
Things at your house  
Like her old belt sander.  
  
O'Salamander,  
O'Salamander,  
It's not what you planned and her  
Tears are all dry  
You just couldn't land her  
  
O'Salamander,  
O'Salamander,  
She's not coming back and her  
Bags are all packed  
And her life will be grander
