#Full of Happiness
*By: The Disappointed Chickens Boy Band*  
*(Johnny, Ronnie, Lonny, Donny and Carl)*  

*CHORUS:*  
I'm going to fill you full of happiness,  
I know you won't think twice,  
Oooo girl, I'll show you happiness,  
It's gonna be real nice  
Oooo, baby, oooo baby,  oooo baby, ooooo  

It's dangerous out in the world baby,  
Full of fear and hate,  
But girl, share my happiness,  
And things will turn out great,  
  
*CHORUS*  
  
Mandatory cheesy rap interlude (Carl):  
Yo, yo, yo baby girl,  
Listen to me,  
I'm gonna show you great big happiness,  
You've just gotta see.   
I'm just gonna say it,  
You might think it's dumb,  
But some day soon girl,  
Your prince is gonna come.  
  
*CHORUS*  
  
We'll go up to your room tonight,  
And with a little luck,  
The moon will be full in the sky,  
And we'll lay down and fff...  
....fill you full of happiness,  
I know you won't think twice,  
Oooo girl, I'll show you happiness,  
It's gonna be real nice  
Oooo, baby, oooo baby,  oooo baby, ooooo
