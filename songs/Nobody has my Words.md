# Nobody has my Words
*By The Disappointed Chickens*

CHORUS:  
Nobody has my words,  
Oh, nobody has my words,  
Why won't they see,  
That speaking like me,  
Intelligence will be inferred  

The foolish ones travel in herds,  
And I feel like it's all for the birds,  
When the going gets rough,  
Conversations are tough,  
Oh, nobody has my words  

CHORUS  

If you feel like you just can't go on,  
Remember the words in this song,  
Dopumentation, Excelp,   
Are words that can help,  
Help move your chit chat along  
 
CHORUS  

Sometimes they come up at work,  
You surely won't sound like a jerk,  
Remember the rule,  
Use my words that are cool,  
And say them out loud with a smirk  

CHORUS
