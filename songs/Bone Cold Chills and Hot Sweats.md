# Bone Cold Chills and Hot Sweats 
*by The Disappointed Chickens*  

I felt better after a shower,  
but not so much again right now…  
doesn’t help that I keep going outside  

I got the Bone Cold Chills and Hot Sweats,  
I woulda stayed home to play with my pets,  
doesn’t help that I keep going outside  

Work needs me, and I didn't wanna go,  
but Service Desk is calling right now...  
doesn’t help that I keep going outside
