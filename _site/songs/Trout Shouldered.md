# Trout Shouldered
*By The Disappointed Chickens*  

When the world outside has got you down,  
And you want to scream and shout,  
Just let it all flow over you,  
Have the shoulders of a trout.   

*CHORUS:*  
If everyone is coming at you,  
Throwing stones and boulders,  
Just let it all pass you by,  
Rolling over your trout shoulders.  

If you have no confidence,   
You're full of fear and doubt,  
Just let it all wash away,  
You have the shoulders of a trout.   

*CHORUS*  

Nothing seems to go your way,  
What's that all about?  
Just let it run right off your back,  
Be the shoulders of a trout.  

*CHORUS*
