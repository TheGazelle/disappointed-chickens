I was at my desk working on the Schofield diamond robbery case when the dame walked in to my office without knocking.  I gave her a quick look over - she was wearing a mink coat and a black eye.

"Are you Mr. Lyle Hammer?", she asked.  

"You got it, babe."  I wasn't sure yet what her angle was, but I was determined to get to the bottom of it.

"I need your help."

"Lotta people need my help.  What can I do for you?"

Her reply threw me for a loop, "ICS is down again"
